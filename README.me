# 📂 Data Science & Python Portfolio

Welcome to my code repository. This collection features my personal projects ranging from independent economic analysis and sports result prediction to web development and utility scripts.

## 🛠 Projects

### 1. 🛒 Independent Market Inflation Tracker (Fort Atacadista)
*Project directory: `/FORT`*

This project aims to create an independent index for market inflation in Brazil, providing an alternative to government statistics by tracking real-world shelf prices daily.

* **`FortAtacadista.py`**: A web scraping bot designed to run as a scheduled daily task. It navigates the Fort Atacadista e-commerce site to capture the current pricing of the entire product catalog.
* **`FortSTD`**: The analytical pipeline. It ingests the raw data appended by the scraper, processes historical trends, and generates insights regarding price fluctuations and true inflation rates.

### 2. ⚽ Portuguese Football Predictor (Liga Portugal)
*Project directory: `/FUTEBOL PORTUGUES`*

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that scrapes football data, processes it, and predicts match outcomes using Neural Networks and Random Forest algorithms.

**Data Collection & Processing:**
* **`GetFutData.py`**: Scrapes **Transfermarkt** to gather detailed stats on every Portuguese team (player values, squad depth, etc.).
* **`GetGameResults.py`**: Scrapes **Flashscore** to retrieve historical match results and statistics for rounds already played.
* **`FutNovaRodada.py`**: Fetches the schedule for the upcoming round of games.

**Machine Learning:**
* **`FUTML.py`**: The core engine. It joins the three datasets mentioned above, constructs the feature set for the next fixture, and applies **Random Forest** and **Neural Network** classifiers to predict the winner of each match.

### 3. 🌐 Web Portfolio Server
* **`SERVER.py`**: A **Flask** application that serves my portfolio website. It acts as the backend to display the visualizations (Tableau) and results generated by the data science projects listed above.

### 4. 🧩 Utilities & Mini-Projects
* **`WATERMARK.py`**: A Python automation tool that accepts image uploads and programmatically applies a text watermark.
* **`TICTACTOE.py`**: A classic implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game logic in Python.
